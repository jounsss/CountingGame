# Prototype requirements

- display random two numbers (<10)
- display random operator
- user has to enter result of the numbers applied to the operation
- give feedback if correct or not

- operator is first only '+'. As the user progresses the operator can change first '-' (the answers should at first above 0), then '*', etc.
- ?try rxJs?
